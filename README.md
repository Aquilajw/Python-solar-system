# Simulating the solar system with under 100 lines of code in Python

This is a Python program I wrote attempting to simulate a (somewhat)
realistic solar system with minimal lines of code.

## Modules required
numpy, matplotlib, astropy, astroquery

## How to run
With the required modules installed, simply run the program, e.g. in UNIX command line
```bash
python solar_system.py
```
Change `sim_start_date` and `sim_duration` in the beginning of the code to change the beginning date of the simulation and the simulation duration.
